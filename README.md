# Apollon Coin Easy Install Script
This easy install shell script was adopted from Zoldur's script.  Thank-you to him for doing most of the work.  The script helps you quickly and easily install an [Apollon Masternode](http://apolloncoin.io/) on a Linux server running Ubuntu 16.04. Use it on your own risk.
***

## Installation
```
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoldur/Apollon/master/apollon_install.sh  
bash apollon_install.sh
```

1. Open the Apollon Desktop Wallet.  
2. Go to RECEIVE and create a New Address: **MN1**  
3. Send **25000** XAP to **MN1**.  
4. Wait for 16 confirmations.  
5. Go to **Help -> "Debug Window - Console"**  
6. Type the following command: **masternode outputs**  
7. Go to **Masternodes** tab  
8. Click **Create** and fill the details:  
* Alias: **MN1**  
* Address: **VPS_IP:PORT**  
* Privkey: **Masternode Private Key**  
* TxHash: **First value from Step 6**  
* Output index:  **Second value from Step 6**  
* Reward address: leave blank

9. Click **OK** to add the masternode  
10. Click **Start All**

## Usage:
```
Apollond masternode status  
Apollond getinfo
```
Also, if you want to check/start/stop **Apollon**, run one of the following commands as **root**:

```
systemctl status Apollon #To check if Apollon service is running  
systemctl start Apollon #To start Apollon service  
systemctl stop Apollon #To stop Apollon service  
systemctl is-enabled Apollon #To check if Apollon service is enabled on boot  
```

## Issues:
For some reasons when Apollon starts for the first time, it will not  update the blockchain. Try this to fix
```
Apollond getinfo
systemctl stop Apollon
rm -r /root/.Apollon/{blk0001.dat,mncache.dat,peers.dat,smsgDB,smsg.ini,txleveldb}
sleep 10
systemctl start Apollon
Apollond getinfo
```
